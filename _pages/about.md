I am an enthusisatic robotics researcher focusing on the development of future reconfigurable and multi-functional robots via smart materials, robot compositions and manufacturing. For future robots to replace human labors in **_boring_**, **_repetitive_** and **_dangerous_** jobs, they are also required to yield **safe**, **collaborative** and **adaptive** behaviors in all human involved circumstances. 

Philosophically, I believe robot equal intelligence in both physical and artifical domains. As a mechanical engineer, I seek to exploit engineering benefits from both rigid and soft materials and structures, and to combine those for establishing future robots with reconfigurable states and multi-modal functionalities. Specifically, my research goal can be addressed via 1) reconfigurable hard and soft robot designs and mechanisms; 2) safe human-robot interface and soft functional robotic devices; and 3) Smart robot manufacutring and biomimetic robotic features.
