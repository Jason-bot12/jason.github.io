I am an enthusisatic robotics researcher interested in the development of future reconfigurable and multi-functional robots via smart materials, robot compositions and manufacturing. As robots are gradually replacing human labors in _boring_, _repetitive_ and _dangerous_ jobs, they are also required to yield **safe**, **collaborative** and **adaptive** behaviors in all human involved circumstances. This brings up challenges for robot safety, adaptiveness and multifunctionality that used to be addressed from advanced perception and control algorithms, but yet require equal complexities in physical designs and robot mechanisms. 

My approach relies on exploiting engineering benefits from both rigid and soft materials and structures, and to combine those for establishing future robots with reconfigurable states and multi-modal functionalities. Specifically, such an ambition can be addresse via 1) reconfigurable hard and soft robot designs and mechanisms, 2) safe human-robot interface and soft functional robotic devices, and 3) Smart robot manufacutring and biomimetic robotic features.
