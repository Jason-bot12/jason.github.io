### MAE 207, [Bioinspired Mobile Robotics](http://gravishlab.ucsd.edu/teaching/)
Graduate level course (ME, EE, BioE)
- Fundamentals of robot locomotion, control and bio-inspired mechanisms (e.g., CPG control in multi-linkage robots, underactutated leg designs).
- Lab-based experimental sessions to build customized quadrupedal robots. [link](https://twitter.com/ucsdjacobs/status/1007075113735413760)
- Involving robot manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing, and laser cutting), motor control, inverse kinematics and dyanmics.
