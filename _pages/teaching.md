### MAE 207, [Bioinspired Mobile Robotics](http://gravishlab.ucsd.edu/teaching/)
Graduate level course (ME, EE, BioE)
- Fundamentals of robot locomotion, control and bio-inspired mechanisms (e.g., CPG control in multi-linkage robots, underactutated leg designs).
- Lab-based experimental sessions to build customized quadrupedal robots. [link](https://twitter.com/ucsdjacobs/status/1007075113735413760)
- Involving robot manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing, and laser cutting), motor control, inverse kinematics, and dyanmics control.


### MAE 156A, [Fundamental Principles of Mechanical Designs](https://mae156a.eng.ucsd.edu/)
Undergraduate level course (ME, EE, BioE)
- Fundamentals of mechanical engineering design principles
- Application of engineering science to the design and analysis of mechanical components.
- Initiation of team design projects that culminate in MAE 156B for with functional prototypes for real engineering [applications](https://mae156b.eng.ucsd.edu/projects/projects-winter-2022).
